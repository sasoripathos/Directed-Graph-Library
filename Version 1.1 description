Version 1.1 can records the directed graph and find the length of the shortest paths between any two vertices using SPFA (with Samll
Label First optimization)

Going to add in version 2.0:
Tarjan algorithm to find the Strongly Connected Components of the graph

Plan to do:
1. a method to reconstructe the graph for doing algorithms about Network Flow
2. Adjust algorithms in order to be able to check the negative cycle.
