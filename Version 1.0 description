Version 1.0 can records the directed graph and find the length of the shortest paths between any two vertices using SPFA.

Going to add in version 1.1:
1. the destruction of the DirectedGraph
2. a optimization of SPFA (Small Label First)

Plan to do:
1. Tarjan algorithm to find the Strongly Connected Components of the graph
2. a method to reconstructe the graph for doing algorithms about Network Flow
3. Adjust algorithms in order to be able to check the negative cycle.
